                    <p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                        demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
                        foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; And equal blame belongs to those who fail
                        in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil
                        and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our
                        power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like
                        best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and
                        owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that
                        pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in
                        these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
                        pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse And equal blame belongs to those who fail in
                        their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
                        pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power
